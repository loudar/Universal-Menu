# Universal-Menu
An universal menu made in QB64.

# Usage
You can use this code for free in your projects, however you have to give credit either in the program itself or the place where you share the project.

# Questions & Suggestions
If you want me to implement more (like a dropdown box, which is in the works), please use the "Issues" page on this GitHub repository. I'm also available on Discord: loudar#0582
